## Tutorial
First install openfoodfacts with ``pip install openfoodfacts``</br>
Then run the program with ``python main.py``</br>
Here you will be prompted to pick a dietary restriction from a list of templates or enter a custom one.</br>
If you chose to enter a custom dietary restriction you can write as many ingredients in the terminal as you want.</br>
When you are done with this, you can enter a barcode for a product.</br>
Here is a list of barcodes for different products:<br>
- 5704727990365 : Chili nuts
- 7622300336738 : Oreo
- 5712871110522 : Kidney beans
- 5700426293929 : Milk
<br>

Once this is done the program will tell you if the food is safe to eat or not, as well as asking if you want to try with another product.
